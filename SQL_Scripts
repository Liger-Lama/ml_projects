###single array formatting into table in bigquery: 
---sample code
with temp as (select column1, split(column2,',') as column2 from table)

select column1, column2 from temp 
cross join unnest(temp.column2) as column2 


###multiple arrays formatting into table in bigquery: 
---sample code
with temp as 
            (select column1, 
                    split(column2,',') as column2,
                    split(column3,',') as column3,
                    split(column3,',') as column4
             from table)
             
select column1,
       column2,
       column3, 
       column4
from temp 
unnest(column2) as column2 with offset
join unnest(column3) as column3 with offset
using(offset)
join unnest(column4) as column4 with offset
using(offset)

---example
with temp as (    
              select program,course_run_code,split(replace(component_records,course_run_code||':',''),',') as components,
                     split(component_start_date,',') as component_start_date,
                     split(component_end_date,',') as component_end_date
              from `table_1`
              )   

select program,course_run_code,components, component_start_date,component_end_date
from temp,
unnest(components) as components with offset
join unnest(component_start_date) AS component_start_date with offset
using(offset)
join unnest(component_end_date) AS component_end_date with offset
using(offset)
